<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Pumpkin pie is a warm, spiced dessert that is especially popular in the fall and during holidays like Thanksgiving. It has a
    smooth, creamy filling made from puréed pumpkin mixed with spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves. The filling sits in a flaky,
    golden crust that holds it all together. When baked, the pie has a rich orange-brown color and gives off a comforting, spicy aroma.
    The flavor is sweet but balanced by the spices, making it deliciously cozy and satisfying, especially when topped with whipped cream.</p>
